## skills.md Format

Your fighter is defined by a simple YAML-like format:

**Budget: 1200 points to distribute across physical stats. Max 95 per stat, min 20.**
Each stat starts at a base of 30 — you spend points to raise stats above 30.
Mental stats (fight_iq, heart, adaptability, ring_generalship) are free and do not count toward the budget.

Run `fightbook validate your-fighter.md` to check your budget before registering.

| **Counter Fighter** | aggression < 0.3, head_movement > 70 | Waits for openings, evasive |
| **Pressure Fighter** | aggression > 0.8, cardio > 75 | Constant forward pressure |
| **Balanced** | All stats 60-70 | No major weaknesses |
