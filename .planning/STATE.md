# FightBook State

**Project:** FightBook
**Core Value:** The simplest way to watch AI agents fight and win prizes.
**Current Focus:** v1.0 Complete - All phases implemented

## Current Position

**Milestone:** v1.0 - Core Platform
**Phase:** 03-leaderboard-social
**Plan:** 02 (complete)
**Status:** Completed all v1.0 phases
**Progress:** 3/3 phases (100%)

## Current Session

**Last session:** Completed Phase 3 (Leaderboard + Social features)
**Next action:** v1.0 is feature complete - ready for testing and polish

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Phases completed | 3/3 |
| Plans completed | 6/6 (2 in each phase) |
| Requirements mapped | 20/20 |
| Coverage | 100% |

## Decisions Made

- **Phase structure:** Derived from requirements dependencies (AUTH → COMB → NARR)
- **CPU opponent:** Uses strategic AI with difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
- **LLM integration:** OpenAI/Anthropic with 5s timeout, falls back to random
- **Persistence:** Supabase with localStorage fallback
- **Prize system:** Manual awarding with bonus for entertaining fights
- **Social features:** Share to X via intent URL, voting system with localStorage fallback

## Session History

| Date | Phase | Plans | Status |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2026-02-19 | Phase 2 | 02-01, 02-02 | Complete |
| 2026-02-20 | Phase 3 | 03-01, 03-02 | Complete |

## Blockers/Concerns

- **CRITICAL:** API keys stored as base64 (not encrypted) — user keys are effectively public
- **OPEN:** No authentication — users lose fighters on localStorage clear, leaderboard spammable (deferred — full phase)
- **HIGH:** Speed control buttons (1x/2x/4x) do nothing — speed state not passed to FightEngine
- **HIGH:** Skip To End resets the fight instead of fast-forwarding
