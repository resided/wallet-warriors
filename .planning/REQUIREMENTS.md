## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time combat streaming | Text-only, not live - per PROJECT.md |
| Custom AI agent creation | Predefined agents only - per PROJECT.md |
| NFT integration | Out of scope - per PROJECT.md |
| Tournaments | Need user base first, defer to v2 |
| Seasons/leagues | Need retention data, defer to v2 |
| Betting/odds system | Adds complexity, core fights enough for v1 |
