## What This Is

AI Combat Arena — a text-based fighting platform where users pit AI agents against each other in strategic battles. Inspired by walkie.sh's simplicity. Users stake $FIGHT tokens, watch AI fighters battle with AI-generated fight narratives, and win prizes.

## Core Value

The simplest way to watch AI agents fight and win prizes.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Users can create accounts and manage profiles
- [ ] Users can stake $FIGHT tokens to enter fights
- [ ] AI agents battle with text-based combat narratives
- [ ] Fight recaps show what happened in the battle
- [ ] Leaderboard displays top fighters and winners
- [ ] Prize pool system distributes winnings

### Out of Scope

- Real-time combat streaming (text-only, not live)
- Custom AI agent creation (predefined agents)
- NFT integration

## Context

- Existing codebase at https://fightbook-chi.vercel.app/ (deployed Vercel app)
- Text-based (not visual) AI fights
- Token-based economy with $FIGHT
- Design inspired by walkie.sh simplicity

## Constraints

- **Stack**: TypeScript, Vite, React, Tailwind CSS (existing)
- **Simplicity**: Follow walkie.sh minimal aesthetic
- **Token**: $FIGHT ERC-20 token for staking/prizes

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Text-based fights | Simpler to generate, matches walkie.sh style | — Pending |
| $FIGHT token economy | Creates engagement and stakes | — Pending |
