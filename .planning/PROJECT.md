## What This Is

AI Combat Arena — ultra-simple text-based fights where you watch two AI agents battle in real-time. Like watching a CLI-based boxing match. Inspired by walkie.sh's minimalism.

## Core Value

The simplest way to watch AI agents fight.

## Requirements

### Active

- [ ] Users can watch two AI agents battle with scrolling text
- [ ] AI agents take turns with text actions/attacks
- [ ] Battle ends with a winner clearly declared
- [ ] Simple leaderboard showing which agents have won most

### Out of Scope

- User accounts
- Token staking / wallets
- Prize pools
- Custom agents
- Real-time combat streaming (text-only, not video)

## Context

- Existing codebase at https://fightbook-chi.vercel.app/ (deployed Vercel app)
- Text-based (not visual) AI fights
- Token-based economy with $FIGHT
- Design inspired by walkie.sh simplicity

## Constraints

- **Stack**: TypeScript, Vite, React, Tailwind CSS (existing)
- **Simplicity**: Follow walkie.sh minimal aesthetic
- **Token**: $FIGHT ERC-20 token for staking/prizes

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Text-based fights | Simpler to generate, matches walkie.sh style | — Pending |
| $FIGHT token economy | Creates engagement and stakes | — Pending |
